## 🚀 Key Projects

### Socially-Aware Robot Navigation with VLM  
- Designed a multimodal navigation system using spatiotemporal graph Transformers and vision–language models for semantic understanding, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making in complex indoor environments.  
- Integrated GPT-4o for real-time RGB image classification (corridor/turn/open area) as node attention biases; achieved 73% zero-shot social group detection accuracy and reduced collision rate by 19%.  
- Employed PPO with KL-penalty for end-to-end joint optimization and developed a VLM→ST-Graph feature adapter. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

### AI-Powered E. coli Pollution Prediction Device  
- Independently designed solar-powered buoy nodes monitoring five water parameters (turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity); implemented high-throughput data handling with Flask + MQTT.  
- Deployed a preloaded wavelet transform + autocorrelation feature model on edge devices, achieving 87% prediction accuracy; enabled sleep–wake control and provided Web Dashboard & Flutter mobile app visualizations. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

### Multi-Agent Robot Delivery Tasks  
- Developed improved CBS-A* with parallelized RRT★ for candidate path generation and evaluation; integrated D* Lite for local re-planning, achieving collision-free simulation.  
- Built an MPC controller and aligned simulation with reality in PyBullet using ArUco markers and projection algorithms; successfully deployed on TurtleBot. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
